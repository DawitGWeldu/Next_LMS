      "summary": "The debugging task has been successfully completed by adding diagnostic logging to identify where the progress reporting chain breaks. I've added comprehensive logging to all components in the chain:\n\n1. Service Worker - Added detailed logging of progress message sending, including progress percentage, stage, file count, and timing information.\n2. Service Worker Registry - Added logging for message reception, tracking of progress updates, and timing between updates.\n3. ScormPreview Component - Added logging for progress callback execution and visualization of update history.\n4. ScormLoadingIndicator - Enhanced to show raw progress values and update timestamps.\n\nThese changes will help identify exactly where the progress reporting chain breaks by providing visibility into:\n- Whether progress messages are being sent by the service worker\n- Whether they are being received by the registry\n- Whether updates are reaching the ScormPreview component\n- Whether the UI is properly updated based on progress state\n\nThe additional debug panels and visual indicators will make it easy to test with real SCORM packages and determine the exact issue with the progress indicator.",
