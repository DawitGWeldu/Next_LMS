      "summary": "Successfully implemented the SCORM type indicator in the course listings. Added a new column that displays a visual badge indicating whether a course is SCORM-based or standard. Updated the Course type to include SCORM package information, and modified the courses page query to include the SCORM package data. The implementation follows the existing UI patterns with consistent styling and clear visual differentiation. SCORM courses are now easily identifiable with a green badge and BookOpen icon, while standard courses have a subtle outline badge.",
