Implement a Zustand store with the following features:\n   - Store progress information by package key\n   - Track progress percentage, stage, file counts, elapsed time\n   - Implement action to update progress with throttling logic\n   - Add action to clear progress for a specific package key\n   - Add selector to get progress for a specific package key\n3. Ensure the store is client-side only ('use client' directive)\n4. Follow Zustand best practices with typed state and actions",
      "verificationCriteria": "1. Store successfully creates and maintains separate progress state for different package keys\n2. Includes all necessary progress information (percentage, stage, file counts, etc.)\n3. Implements throttling logic to prevent excessive updates\n4. Follows the project's TypeScript conventions with proper type definitions\n5. Is properly exported for use in other components",
      "analysisResult": "The SCORM package system has issues with inconsistent download progress reporting and redundant logging due to the lack of a central shared state. Each instance of the ScormPreview component maintains its own state and logs the same progress updates independently.

The store maintains progress information indexed by package key, implements throttling logic based on progress changes and time thresholds, provides methods to update and clear progress, and follows TypeScript conventions with proper type definitions. The store also includes helper functions to access progress for a specific package and integrates well with the existing ProgressInfo type from service-worker-registry.",
